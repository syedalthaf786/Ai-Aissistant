This script is a simple starting point for building your own voice-controlled personal assistant. Feel free to experiment and customize it further! ```I have a question about the code. Can you explain what the pyautogui library is used for in this script?The pyautogui library is used in this script to interact with the user's computer. Specifically, it is used to:

    Open applications: When the user says "open [app name]", pyautogui is used to simulate keyboard input to open the specified application.
    Close windows: When the user says "close", pyautogui is used to simulate the keyboard shortcut "Alt + F4" to close the current window.
    Toggle full screen and theater screen modes: When the user says "full screen" or "theater screen", pyautogui is used to simulate the keyboard shortcuts "F" and "T" respectively to toggle these modes.

pyautogui is a cross-platform GUI automation library for Python, which means it can be used to automate interactions with the graphical user interface of a computer. It's a powerful tool for automating tasks and can be used in a variety of applications, including testing, automation, and even game development.
